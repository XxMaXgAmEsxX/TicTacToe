# TicTacToe
- This is a piece of code I wrote about 4 weeks after learning C#.
- It works by using variables and methods
- There are no array or objects used here as I hadn't learnt them at this time (It would be a lot more efficient and use less lines of code)
- There is alot of 'else if', I didn't think a switch could do this
- Made on 31st October 2024
